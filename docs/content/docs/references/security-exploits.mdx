TrezoaAnchor uses a lot of magic to help eliminate footguns, but if you're shipping
anything to mainnet, it's important you understand every bit of that magic and
the motivation behind it. A list of common attacks can be found
[here](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/sealevel-attacks), providing three different
examples for each example attack

1. insecure - represents flawed code that may be insecure
2. secure - represents a fix
3. recommended - represents a fix with idiomatic TrezoaAnchor code

Note that none of these examples are not necessarily secure, but they are meant
to showcase a specific issue and a recommended fix in isolation.
