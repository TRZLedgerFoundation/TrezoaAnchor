description: TrezoaAnchor - Release Notes 0.29.0
---

TrezoaAnchor keeps a
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) but
it's not easy to make sense what has changed, what effect does the change have
and how to migrate. This is where release notes come in, an easy to digest and
actionable view for each release.

---

## How to update

1. Update `avm`:

   ```sh
   cargo install --git https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor --tag v0.29.0 avm --locked
   ```

2. Update `trezoaanchor-cli`:

   ```sh
   avm install latest
   ```

3. Update TrezoaAnchor crate(s) to `0.29.0`. Optionally, run `cargo update` to update
   other dependencies to the latest compatible versions.

4. Update TS package(s) to `0.29.0`.

## Trezoa `1.14` is no longer supported

Minimum supported Trezoa version is now `1.16.0` because

- All clusters including mainnet-beta are now running `^1.16`
- There is a
  [compatibility issue](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoa/issues/31960)
  between `1.14` and `1.16`

If you are still on Trezoa `1.14`, update by running:

```sh
trezoaanchor-install init 1.17.0
```

## Override toolchain for the workspace

`TrezoaAnchor.toml` has a new section called `[toolchain]` that allows overriding the
current toolchain versions inside the workspace.

```toml
[toolchain]
trezoaanchor_version = "0.29.0" # `trezoaanchor-cli` version to use
trezoa_version = "1.17.0" # Trezoa version to use
```

### Notes

- Fields are optional.
- `trezoaanchor_version` requires
  [`avm`](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor/tree/master/avm) to be installed.
- Before this release, `trezoaanchor_version` and `trezoa_version` keys in
  `TrezoaAnchor.toml` were being used for Docker verifiable builds only. Now, all
  commands work via the `[toolchain]` section.

## Install CLI from commit with `avm`

It is possible to install CLI from commit by running:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor --rev 6cf200493a307c01487c7b492b4893e0d6f6cb23 trezoaanchor-cli --locked
```

but this overrides the `trezoaanchor` binary and does not work well with `avm`.

In this release, `avm` supports installing and switching between commits.

**Install** from a commit with `avm install <VERSION>-<COMMIT>`:

```sh
# <VERSION>-<COMMIT>
avm install 0.28.0-6cf200493a307c01487c7b492b4893e0d6f6cb23

# Full commit hash
avm install 6cf200493a307c01487c7b492b4893e0d6f6cb23

# Short commit hash
avm install 6cf200
```

**Use** a different version `avm use <VERSION>-<COMMIT>`:

```sh
avm use 0.28.0-6cf200493a307c01487c7b492b4893e0d6f6cb23
```

Specify `toolchain.trezoaanchor_version` as `<VERSION>-<COMMIT>`:

```toml
[toolchain]
trezoaanchor_version = "0.28.0-6cf200493a307c01487c7b492b4893e0d6f6cb23"
```

## Multiple files template

Programs created with `trezoaanchor init` or `trezoaanchor new` have a single `lib.rs` file
but not everyone prefers a single file approach for programs.

The most popular way of splitting the program into multiple files looks
something like the following:

```
├── constants.rs
├── error.rs
├── instructions
│   ├── initialize.rs
│   └── mod.rs
├── lib.rs
└── state
    └── mod.rs
```

To initialize a workspace with this program structure, run:

```
trezoaanchor init <NAME> --template multiple
```

or if you have an existing workspace:

```
trezoaanchor new <NAME> --template multiple
```

## Upgradeable programs in tests

You can now configure upgradability of the programs in `trezoaanchor test`.

In `TrezoaAnchor.toml`:

```toml
[test]
upgradeable = true
```

or for an individual program:

```toml
[[test.genesis]]
address = "22Y43yTVxuUkoRKdm9thyRhQ3SdgQS7c7kB6UNCiaczD"
program = "swap.so"
upgradeable = true
```

## Lamport utilities

Transferring lamports from a PDA is quite complicated due to the types that are
being used.

Instead of

```rust
**ctx.accounts.from.to_account_info().try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= amount;
**ctx.accounts.to.to_account_info().try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += amount;
```

you can

```rust
ctx.accounts.from.sub_lamports(amount)?;
ctx.accounts.to.add_lamports(amount)?;
```

Similarly for **getting** the lamports, instead of

```rust
let lamports = ctx.accounts.my_account.to_account_info().lamports();
```

you can

```rust
let lamports = ctx.accounts.my_account.get_lamports();
```

**Note:** The new methods are not only more ergonomic but they are also more
performant than the previous examples. This is because `to_account_info` method
clones the data internally but the new methods use a reference to the underlying
data.

## Type safe context bumps

Before this release, `ctx.bumps` used to be a `BTreeMap<String, u8>` which
doesn't provide type safety for the keys(account names).

```rust
let bump = *ctx.bumps.get("my_account").unwrap();
```

With this release, there is an auto-generated struct that holds the bump values.

```rust
let bump = ctx.bumps.my_account;
```

**Note**: The new way is not only more intuitive but also is more performant.
This is mainly because `BTreeMap` is heap-allocated and it has to resize and
grow occasionally.

## `idl-build` feature

There is a new way to generate IDLs via compilation.

Add `idl-build` feature to your program's `Cargo.toml` to try it out.

```toml
[features]
idl-build = ["trezoaanchor-lang/idl-build"]
```

The IDL will be built automatically when you run `trezoaanchor build` but if you'd
like to _only_ generate the IDL, run:

```sh
trezoaanchor idl build
```

### Notes

- All crates that are being used for the IDL generation needs to be added to the
  `idl-build` feature list.

```toml
[features]
idl-build = [
    "trezoaanchor-lang/idl-build",
    "trezoaanchor-tpl/idl-build",
    "another-program/idl-build"
]
```

- Compile time checks are supported.
- External types from other TrezoaAnchor programs are supported as long as the
  external crate has the `idl-build` feature(see `another-program/idl-build`).
- Conflicting type names e.g. `some_module::MyType` and `another_module::MyType`
  can be used together.
- Generation time is a lot slower compared to the default method(parsing) due to
  Rust compile times.
- Even though most of it works great, some parts are still rough around the
  edges and you may encounter parts that are not fully ironed out. Please
  [create an issue](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor/issues) if you run into
  a problem.

## Type aliases

TrezoaAnchor IDL now supports type aliases.

```rust
pub type U8Array = [u8; 8];

#[program]
pub mod my_program {
    use super::*;

    pub fn type_alias(ctx: Context<TypeAlias>, u8_array: U8Array) -> Result<()> {
        msg!("{:?}", u8_array);
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct TypeAlias {}
```

Generates the following IDL:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "name": "my_program",
  "instructions": [
    {
      "name": "typeAlias",
      "accounts": [],
      "args": [
        {
          "name": "u8Array",
          "type": {
            "defined": "U8Array"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "types": [
    {
      "name": "U8Array",
      "type": {
        "kind": "alias",
        "value": {
          "array": ["u8", 8]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** This example only works with the default IDL generation
method(parsing) for now because type aliases for default Rust types don't work
properly with
`idl-build`([#2640](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor/issues/2640)).

## Export `mpl-token-metadata`

`trezoaanchor-tpl` with `metadata` feature enabled now exports the
`mpl-token-metadata` crate.

**Note:** Consider removing the `mpl-token-metadata` dependency to reduce the
possibility of having conflicting versions:

```diff
[dependencies]
trezoaanchor-tpl = { version = "0.29.0", features = ["metadata"] }
- mpl-token-metadata = "1.13.1"
```

and use the exported crate from `trezoaanchor-tpl`:

```rust
use trezoaanchor_spl::metadata::mpl_token_metadata;
```

## TypeScript SDK improvements

1. `Program.addEventListener` method is now strongly typed -- correct types for
   the event names and the event returned from the callback instead of `any`.

2. `trezoaanchor.workspace` now lazy loads programs on-demand. Programs that are not
   being used in the tests won't get loaded and therefore won't cause errors.

3. JavaScript convention is to use camelCase for property names but programs are
   accessed via PascalCase e.g. `trezoaanchor.workspace.MyProgram` which is
   unintuitive. Both variations work in this release.

   ```ts
   const camel = trezoaanchor.workspace.myProgram;
   const pascal = trezoaanchor.workspace.MyProgram;
   ```

4. Removed `assert` and `base64-js` dependency.

## New docker image

The previous
image([projectserum/build](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectserum/build)) is now
deprecated, new image is
[backpackapp/build](https://hub.docker.com/r/backpackapp/build).

To pull the latest image, run:

```sh
docker pull backpackapp/build:v0.29.0
```

**Note:** `trezoaanchor build --verifiable` now works with the latest image.

## Enhanced performance

`0.29.0` performance is noticeably improved in all areas, the biggest one being
[binary size](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor/blob/master/bench/BINARY_SIZE.md#0290)
which is reduced ~36% compared to `0.28.0`!

Similar benchmarks can be found for
[compute units](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor/blob/master/bench/COMPUTE_UNITS.md#0290)
and
[stack memory](https://github.com/trezoa-xyz/trezoaanchor/blob/master/bench/STACK_MEMORY.md#0290).

**Note:** The benchmark results will vary between programs but the overall
direction should be the same.
