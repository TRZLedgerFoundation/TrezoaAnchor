## IDL

### `proc-macro2` build fix

`proc-macro2 1.0.95` removed the `source_file` method of `Span` due to an
underlying `nightly` compiler change
[rust-lang/rust#139671](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/139671), which
resulted in the following error for TrezoaAnchor users:

```
error[E0599]: no method named `source_file` found for struct `proc_macro2::Span` in the current scope
```

This should now be fixed in this release.

## TypeScript

### Account resolver no longer requires wallet

Resolving signers had a wallet requirement, and failing to meet this requirement
resulted in the following error:

```
This function requires the `Provider` interface implementor to have a `wallet` field.
```

Now, it's only required for the `publicKey` field of `Provider` to be set.

### Multiple constant generics

An issue where having multiple constant generics would result in parsing errors
has been fixed.
